# Dividend Instability Risk Detection for Income Investors

## Team
- Team ID: team-27
- Members: Steven Liu, Jonathan Simon

## Overview
This project builds an interpretable machine learning model to flag **dividend instability risk** for dividend-focused ETFs.
We define a forward-looking label: whether an ETF’s **next 12-month dividends fail to increase** relative to the prior 12 months.
We use price-based risk features (volatility, drawdown, momentum) and dividend-based features to classify risk regimes.
