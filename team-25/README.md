## Overview

My project was to create a tool to detect whether a person was drunk or sober based on a picture of their face using Convolutional Neural Networks. Using a dataset of more than a million frames of drunk and sober faces, the ultimate goal is to create a model that can be leveraged in real life situations in stopping irresponsible drivers and DUI-related traffic collisions from happening. 


## Usage
Data Download: Since my datasets are unable to be uploaded to Github due to the file limit, I created a public Kaggle link containing the 2 folders of drunk and sober facial frames and pasted it in the text file "data.txt" in the data folder.  
Running Code: Enter the jupyter notebook "Drunk_Sober_Identification.ipynb" in the src folder named. Ensure that cells 2 & 4 which import the drunk and sober datasets are set to the correct filepaths. Then run the notebook and you will see the plots given at the end. This will take some time given the size of the data needed the model will be training on.
